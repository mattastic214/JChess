Error at Line 26!
long@5@a@List at least two reasons to use a reference parameter. List at least one reason to use a value parameter.@You would use a reference parameter if you need to change the argument and have the change reflected in the caller (for example, if your function has more than one output, so the return value isn't sufficient), or if you need to get the argument itself instead of a copy of it (for example, in a copy constructor). You would use a value parameter in most other cases: in particular, if you need to modify the parameter but not change the original argument, you should use a value parameter. Also, if your function needs to accept a literal argument, it must use a value parameter, because references parameters only accept variables, not literals.
